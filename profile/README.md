# Welcome to the Figurate project

Maintaining Cloud infrastructure is complex, with tools and methodologies still in their infancy. Figurate provides the building blocks for
designing integrated architectures, whilst the Bedrock family focuses on complete patterns and blueprints that deliver on key software design 
principles, such as modularity, reusability and separation of concerns, to Infrastructure-as-code (IaC).

## Figurate

### Terraform Modules

Software development has long benefitted from the ability to reuse proven code in the form of libraries. With IaC we see similar benefits in
Terraform modules, Ansible roles, and other widely published shared code repositories.

### Ansible Roles

TBD.

### Manifests and Templates

TBD.


## Bedrock

### Terraform Blueprints

Blueprints are a combination of published modules, templates and sensible defaults, that enable us to deploy tested architectures with a minimum of
effort. The importance of defaults is to allow an evolution of infrastructure from simple to complex as a deployed solution matures over
time.
